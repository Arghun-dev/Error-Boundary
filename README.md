# Error-Boundary

Note that, error boundaries can just be class components and they can not be a functional component.

In the past, JavaScript errors inside components used to corrupt React’s internal state and cause it to emit cryptic errors on next renders. These errors were always caused by an earlier error in the application code, but React did not provide a way to handle them gracefully in components, and could not recover from them.

A JavaScript error in a part of the UI shouldn’t break the whole app. To solve this problem for React users, React 16 introduces a new concept of an “error boundary”.

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.

## Note

Error Boundaries do not catch errors for: 

1. Event Handlers
2. Asynchronous Code
3. Server Side Rendering
4. Error thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than it's children)

A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines either (or both) of the lifecycle methods `static getDerivedStateFromError()` or `componentDidCatch()`. Use `static getDerivedStateFromError()` to render a fallback UI after an error has been thrown. Use `componentDidCatch()` to log error information.
